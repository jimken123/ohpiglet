Piglet has started to go down the tobogans (or slides if you prefer). She’s quite adept at climbing up the little steps, then she composes herself and sits down at the top. She rolls over onto her tummy before letting go and sliding down. I think she prefers sliding down on her back but can’t quite organise herself yet to start out that way at the top.

Enjoy her latest video.
