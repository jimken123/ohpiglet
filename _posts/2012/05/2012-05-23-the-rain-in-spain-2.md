Piglet was nice and snug in her trailer, sleeping through the brutal weather. We arrived into the province of Burgo on the second day, already wondering what we were doingâ€¦

Eventually we reached the town of Belorado, fluich baite. We took refuge in the first hotel we found.

The following morning the weather was looking a lot better as we set off again.

Piglet laughing at it all again; Rebecca trying to muster a smile, but mostly grimacing through the wetness.
