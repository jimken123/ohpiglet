We began the cycling leg of the Camino in Logroño travelling west along the N-120 national road. Coincidentally, the N-120 itself begins at Logroño.

This means that the kilometer markers are customised exactly for our journey. Every kilometer there’s a little marker. Every ten kilometers there’s a big pillar like this one that we celebrate by ringing our bells.

Yay! 200 kilometers cycled so far.
