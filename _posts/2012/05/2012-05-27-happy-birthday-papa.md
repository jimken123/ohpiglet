Piglet loves camping, and she loves being up bright and early too.

She’s a bit of a camping afficianado at this point.

Later that same day, we celebrated Papa’s birthday by cycling one of our longest days - about 67 km.

The weather was beautiful. There were several stands of trees like this one. I think they are silver birch, Jim’s mother’s favourite.

It was a long day in the saddletrailer for the Piglet.

Undulate, baby, undulate.
