We reached the town of Sahagún and decided to call a halt to the cycling. Long-distance cycling is a very silly idea and not one any sane person should undertake. This is why Piglet choose to travel in a trailer rather than cycle herself.

Piglet hopped on the train to nearby Leon and we ran into another Catalan.

Antoni Gaudi himself, me aul mucker, taking it easy outside a building he designed.
