Leaving Belorado behind Piglet steered a steep course out of Villafranca Montes de Oca towards Burgos. You know the kind of hill where signs warn you to test your brakes on the way down? Well, we climbed one of those - a 6% climb over three kilometers.

At the top, we all take a break, and Piglet sees snow for the first time.

We stopped for lunch in Burgos; peregrino statue guy looks wrecked.
