Training for the camino continues apace. This Sunday, on her second attempt, Piglet made it up and over Tibidabo and down the other side into Sant Cugat.

On the downhill section into Sant Cugat we were unintentionally on the course of the third-oldest cycling race in the world - the Volta Catalunya. We were informed of this by a motorcycle policeman who was telling us to get off the road.

So, for a brief period, Piglet in her chariot was ahead of the peloton, leading the 101st Volta.

Piglet as the peloton whizzes by…

Where did they all go?

They went to Sant Cugat, and so did we. We stopped for lunch at the monastery; they didn’t.

Then we turned around and cycled back up and over Tibidabo, pausing only to visit a playground for Piglet’s first time on a horse:

She loved the swing, which more than made up for being disqualified from the cycling race.

Piglet loves you all, she wanted me to convey that.
