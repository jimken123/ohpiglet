To quote George Bernard Shaw “I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.” History doesn’t record if GBS ever wrestled a piglet, but he was a smart guy, so he probably didn’t.

This monkey, on the other hand, clearly hasn’t read Shaw.

Riu dishes out some serious smackdown to El Mono, and it’s quite apparent that she likes doing it.
