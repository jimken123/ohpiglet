The Barcelona Camino de Santiago route takes you through Montserrat, as you can see from the yellow arrow and the shell symbol.

Our hike today was much shorter, just up to the top of Montserrat itself to see the refugios there.

Nearly at the top. Quite foggy.

Ah yes, here we are at last. Giddy up.

Looking back down at the monastery.

Riu likes a nice climb.
