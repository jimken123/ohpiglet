Piglet with Santi in Logroño when she had just done the first section of the Camino de Santiago. ![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2012/tumblr_m647l2tEab1qlj3bd.jpg)

She’s now 11 months old but she still seems tiny, that is, until you see photos like this one taken when she was just four months old. Look how little she is.
