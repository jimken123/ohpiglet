We stayed a few nights in the divine valley of Vega de Valcarce, the last town in Castille y Leon before the steep climb into Galicia. We met the very sweet, shining and soulful Joanne who cooked us some incredible Brazilian beans with a great tropical salad. We ate outdoors, on the patio and drank wine in the light of Julyâ€™s full moon.

It makes my hair stand up just thinking about it.
