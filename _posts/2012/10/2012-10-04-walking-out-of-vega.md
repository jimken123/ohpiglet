We left Vega very early in the morning, Jim and Riu managed to catch some rays of the rising sun and I caught a bagful of ripe plums to hand out to the other peregrinos along the way.

We walked out of Vega and into Galicia where Riu met her yaya, Granizado Kennedy. Grandmother is ‘la abuela’ in spanish and in motherese it’s contracted down to yaya.
