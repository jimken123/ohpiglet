Rebecca doesn’t do social media, because she’s out there fighting the good fight as a front-line doctor in this pandemic. She just got the first of her two Pfizer-BoiNTech COVID-19 vaccination jabs and asked me to post this photo to let people know that better times are coming.  
Hang in there everyone!
