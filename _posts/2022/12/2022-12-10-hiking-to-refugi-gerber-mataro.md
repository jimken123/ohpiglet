We went on one last big hike for the year before the weather begins to get too cold, We hiked into the Refugi Gerber Mataró in the national park, up to 2446 metres, icy on some stretches - do they make crampons in children sizes? It was pretty chilly at night outside watching the stars and even a meteorite, but with 14 people inside the little orange box tied to the top of a boulder, it was toasty warm in the end. The kids loved their sleeping bags.

The Pyrenees are spectacular, and Rebecca takes some amazing photos!
