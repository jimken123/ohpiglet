Little Piglet caused quite a stir on our travels, and news of our comings and goings travelled far and wide. Quite often we met with groups of other peregrinos who had already heard of us.

Naturally, she was full of smiles and made lots of new friends and has any number of new fans, not least, the lovely man in the Albergue Peregrino Casa Austriana in Los Arcos who made this cool memento for her.

It was there that we also learned a new meaning for Riuâ€™s name. In Japanese, Riu means Dragon - with her flame red hair and burnt orange eyebrows, hear her ROOOOOOOOAR!
