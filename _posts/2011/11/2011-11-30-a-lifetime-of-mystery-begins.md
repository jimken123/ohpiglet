Riu has lost her first sock. Where did it go?

![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2011/tumblr_lva7ejltQQ1qlj3bd.jpg)

It went missing somewhere between along Calle Escorial or Placa Joanic.

How many socks do you lose? Why does it have to happen to one so young? Oh the injustice, oh the humanity.
