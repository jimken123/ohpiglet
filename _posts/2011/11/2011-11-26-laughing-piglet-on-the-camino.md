We found this photo of the piggy buried on the camera, so I thought we would put it up. On the first day of the camino, about eight kilometres into the hiking, we arrived at the first significant waymarker - the refuge at Orisson.

I think she was laughing because she had no idea we were about to hike up and over the Pyrenees.
