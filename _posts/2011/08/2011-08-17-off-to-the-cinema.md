This is what a week-old baby looks like at midnight at the outdoor cinema: asleep. Thatâ€™s her friend Stacey looking after her; we had a little trouble getting her back from Stacey afterwards.

The film was Charade, starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. In July and August they have regular outdoor screening of fairly random films projected onto the side of the castle on Montjuic overlooking the city.
