This is where the pig snorting began. Since we were unsure of a name for her at this point, she became Piglet. If she had been a boy, we would have had a bunch of names from which to choose. Girl’s names are tricky. Stripey hats and clothing are either the way babies are dressed or it’s the fashion this year.
