On the Saturday, a mere four days after her birth, the hospital tells us we can go home. It’s a terrifying prospect, being told you can just walk out the front door of the hospital with a tiny baby. She’s all ours to look after. I half expected us to get challenged at the exit; that it was all a big wind-up. They couldn’t really be letting us take her home. What do we know about looking after babies?

Nobody stopped us at the door, so Piglet came home on the metro, all of two stops from the hospital.
