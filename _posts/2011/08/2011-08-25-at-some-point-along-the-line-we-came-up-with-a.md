At some point along the line we came up with a name more suitable for her than Piglet. We had been through lots of names websites, books of names, even the Catalan online registry. We were looking for a Catalan name, but something that would work at home too with too many pronunciation hassles.

Eventually we came to thinking of things that meant something to both of us, and that naturally lead to kayaking. On a whim, I looked up the Catalan word for ‘river’ and that was that. In the end, it was quite simple, once we waited for the name to announce itself.

Baby Piglet will be known as 'Riu.’
