El bebé’s first social appointment on her first day home was to meet her Grandad and her Auntie Rachel. We all went for dinner on the plaça about 11 PM, and not a murmur of complaint out of her for the lateness of the hour, or for dining so late. Pure local. Most of us had the tapas, piglet had the fresh milk.

Here she is meeting her grandad for the first time…
