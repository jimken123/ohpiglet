So, I introduced Piglet to Heffalump and at first she was all shy and coy.

Then I went to brush my teeth and left them to get to know each other. They had a little chat. She made some piggy noises, he made some scratchy and crackly noises. They talked about the weather (hot). They played some games (educational).

Well.

Then I came back and she was all ‘who are you?'

I feel like my work here is done. Sigh.
