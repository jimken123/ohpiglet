The little Catalan is, of course, a Barça baby. Our friend Liz Palcic (AKA Elizabeth Benbow) knitted us this very cool blau (blue) and grana (deep red) football on her travels.

Liz is a baby-nut herself. On her blog she talks about how it’s knitted - it’s ‘Knit Picks Shine Worsted’ knitting fans. It’s all here on [Liz’s blog](http://elpalchica.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/baby-gifts/).
