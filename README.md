# README

This repo is a fork of [Forever Jekyll](https://foredver-jekyll.github.io) and, minimalist at that origin repo is, I've removed a bunch of stuff that I don't need.

I am using it to migrate my **/ohpiglet** blog away from WordPress and into Jekyll.

For now this repo builds at [jimken123.github.io/ohpiglet/](https://jimken123.github.io/ohpiglet/) but eventually it will go to [mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/](https://mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/).

## Notes to self

Images display easily using this code:

```
![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2024/foo.jpg)
```

## Build locally first

 ```
jekyll serve
 ```

## TODO

### Migrate content from wordpress

### Fix images links

- Change to:
```
![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2024/foo.jpg)
```

### Enable comments

### Enable web analytics

### Add Year table to Archive page
