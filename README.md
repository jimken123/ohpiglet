# README

This repo is a fork of [Forever Jekyll](https://foredver-jekyll.github.io) and, minimalist at that origin repo is, I've removed a bunch of stuff that I don't need.

I am using it to migrate my **/ohpiglet** blog away from WordPress and into Jekyll.

For now this repo builds at [jimken123.github.io/ohpiglet/](https://jimken123.github.io/ohpiglet/) but eventually it will go to [mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/](https://mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/).

## Images

Images display easily using this code:

```
![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2024/foo.jpg)
```

## Videos

Videos should be uploaded to Vimeo and then displayed using the default embed code.

## Build locally first

Built a totally unreliable local build:

 ```
jekyll serve
 ```

## TODO

### Fix images links

### Enable comments

### Enable web analytics

### Add Year table to Archive page

### Video

Videos should be uploaded to Vimeo and then displayed using the default embed code.
