  <p><em>Hello Rebecca! I am new to tumblr. Am I to assume that I have to just keep scrolling down to get to the older ones? I have just found out that I am (potentially) pregnant, and my mom and I are supposed to do the Camino next summer. Baby would be born in late February and we’d leave in late June, so 4-5 months old at the time of the Camino. I was looking through your responses on the camino forums “Camino con baby.”</em> </p>

<p>Our Camino trek was broken into three stages, so scroll down to the first part in October 2011, second part in May 2012, and the final stretch which began September 28, 2012.</p>
