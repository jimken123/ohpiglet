<p>In the early beginning el bebé (as she was known before she became Piglet) was supposed to break out on July 14, Bastille Day. Naively we thought she would arrive on time and we could go to see a gig a week later. This was not to be the case, not remotely.</p>

<p>We got her some noise-cancelling headphone thingies in anticipation of Animal Collective being a little loud for a week-old baby.</p>

<p>El bebé wasn’t in any hurry, so Pink wore the headphones around the house instead.</p>
