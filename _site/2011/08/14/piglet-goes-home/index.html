<p>On the Saturday, a mere four days after her birth, the hospital tells us we can go home. It’s a terrifying prospect, being told you can just walk out the front door of the hospital with a tiny baby. She’s all ours to look after. I half expected us to get challenged at the exit; that it was all a big wind-up. They couldn’t really be letting us take her home. What do we know about looking after babies?</p>

<p>Nobody stopped us at the door, so Piglet came home on the metro, all of two stops from the hospital.</p>
