<p>El bebé’s first social appointment on her first day home was to meet her Grandad and her Auntie Rachel. We all went for dinner on the plaça about 11 PM, and not a murmur of complaint out of her for the lateness of the hour, or for dining so late. Pure local. Most of us had the tapas, piglet had the fresh milk.</p>

<p>Here she is meeting her grandad for the first time…</p>
