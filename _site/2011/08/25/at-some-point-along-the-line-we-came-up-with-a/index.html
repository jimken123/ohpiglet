<p>At some point along the line we came up with a name more suitable for her than Piglet. We had been through lots of names websites, books of names, even the Catalan online registry. We were looking for a Catalan name, but something that would work at home too with too many pronunciation hassles.</p>

<p>Eventually we came to thinking of things that meant something to both of us, and that naturally lead to kayaking. On a whim, I looked up the Catalan word for ‘river’ and that was that. In the end, it was quite simple, once we waited for the name to announce itself.</p>

<p>Baby Piglet will be known as ‘Riu.’</p>
