<p>Thanks Granizado Oglesby for the lovely flowers! Not only did she send flowers after she left, Granizado Oglesby did a makeover on the terrace while she was here, bringing Birds of Paradise, Andalucian flower pots and passion fruit creepers to our world.<img src="/assets/images/2011/tumblr_lrir6vNyxl1qlj3bd.jpg" alt="yo yo" /></p>

<p>Not only is <em>riu</em> Catala for <em>river</em>, our spiritual home, it also means <em>she smiles</em>.</p>

<p>Hooray for flowers, and hooray for baby smiles!</p>
