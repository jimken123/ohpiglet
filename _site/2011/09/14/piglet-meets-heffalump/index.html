<p>So, I introduced Piglet to Heffalump and at first she was all shy and coy.</p>

<p>Then I went to brush my teeth and left them to get to know each other. They had a little chat. She made some piggy noises, he made some scratchy and crackly noises. They talked about the weather (hot). They played some games (educational).</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>Then I came back and she was all ‘who are you?’ </p>

<p>I feel like my work here is done. Sigh.</p>
