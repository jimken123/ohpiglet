<p>We’ve been doing some hiking over the past weekends in preparation for a big hike beginning this weekend. Piglet likes to get out into nature, au naturel, and show off her bacon.</p>

<p>It’s very unusual to see a moon rise in the middle of the day, but sometimes there’s a sliver of a cresent coming up…</p>

<p>On this day we were lucky to experience the rise of the full moon, in all its white, luminous glory…</p>

<p>Hey, Piglet, as well as the moon, I think I can see Uranus from here.</p>
