<p>A fish for each child, flying from the house. Flying Koinobori (carp streamer) is a Japanese tradition in honor of children for a good future and in the hope that they will grow up healthy and strong. The blue one is for Riu, the yellow one for Pau, and the little red one is for Boi. These are our children, and our hope for the future.</p>
