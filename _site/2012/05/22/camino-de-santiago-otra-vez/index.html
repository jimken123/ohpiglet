<p>As you might recall, the first time around Piglet allowed herself to be carried along the Camino de Santiago from St Jean Pied de Port to Logroño. It’s all discussed here: <a href="http://ohpiglet.tumblr.com/post/12514617719/stjeanpieddeport">St Jean Pied de Port</a></p>

<p>So, for the next leg of the Camino Piglet wanted to travel in a little more style - in a bicycle trailer. So she did.</p>

<p>This is the front door of our friend Santiago’s apartment; it’s right on the Camino in downtown Logroño. This is where we finished up the first leg of 200 km.</p>
