<p>Later that same day, we celebrated Papa’s birthday by cycling one of our longest days - about 67 km.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful. There were several stands of trees like this one. I think they are silver birch, Jim’s mother’s favourite.</p>

<p>It was a long day in the saddletrailer for the Piglet.</p>
