<p>Training for the camino continues apace. This Sunday, on her second attempt, Piglet made it up and over Tibidabo and down the other side into Sant Cugat.</p>

<p>On the downhill section into Sant Cugat we were unintentionally on the course of the third-oldest cycling race in the world - the Volta Catalunya. We were informed of this by a motorcycle policeman who was telling us to get off the road.</p>

<p>So, for a brief period, Piglet in her chariot was ahead of the peloton, leading the 101st Volta.</p>

<p>Where did they all go?</p>

<p>They went to Sant Cugat, and so did we. We stopped for lunch at the monastery; they didn’t.</p>

<p>Then we turned around and cycled back up and over Tibidabo, pausing only to visit a playground for Piglet’s first time on a horse:</p>

<p>She loved the swing, which more than made up for being disqualified from the cycling race.</p>

<p>Piglet loves you all, she wanted me to convey that.</p>
