<p>The Barcelona Camino de Santiago route takes you through Montserrat, as you can see from the yellow arrow and the shell symbol.</p>

<p>Our hike today was much shorter, just up to the top of Montserrat itself to see the refugios there.</p>

<p>Nearly at the top. Quite foggy.</p>

<p>Ah yes, here we are at last. Giddy up.</p>
