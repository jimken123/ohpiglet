<p>I am reviving Happy Guy, or East Wally, as an icon around my webs. This is the original graffiti on the north quays in Dublin; he’s gone now, as is the building he was on. He used to be Rebecca’s profile picture…</p>

<p>I found him again on google maps from 2009. He’s been replaced by a steel and glass office building.</p>
