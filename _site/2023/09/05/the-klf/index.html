<p>Once again we have seen Bill Drummond driving around Catalonia in yet another vehicle and I remember my commitment to my occasional series of KLF sightings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’re justified, and they’re ancient<br />
And they drive a sensible and economic Clio<br />
(Just roll it from the top)<br />
They’re justified, and they’re ancient<br />
I hope you understand<br />
(To the torrent del marti, to the torrent del marti, to the torrent del marti now)</p>

  <p>All bound for Mu Mu Land<br />
All bound for Mu Mu Land…</p>
